# Changelog

This file tracks changes to this project. It follows the [Keep a Changelog format](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased

### Removed

- `FiniteReplayProvider.{Count, AutoIDs}` – use the constructor instead

### Changed

- Due to a change in the internal implementation, the `FiniteReplayProvider` is now able to replay events only if the event with the LastEventID provided by the client is still buffered. Previously if the LastEventID was that of the latest removed event, events would still be replayed. This detail added complexity to the implementation without an apparent significant win, so it was dropped.
### Added

- `NewFiniteReplayProvider` constructor

### Fixed

- `FiniteReplayProvider` doesn't leak memory anymore and respects the stored messages count it was given. Previously when a new message was put after the messages count was reached and some other messages were removed, the total messages count would grow unexpectedly and `FiniteReplayProvider` would store and replay more events than it was configured to.

## [0.8.0] - 2024-01-30

This version removes all external dependencies of `go-sse`. All our bugs are belong to us! It also does some API and documentation cleanups.

### Removed

- `Client.DefautReconnectionTime`, `Client.MaxRetries` have been replaced with the new `Client.Backoff` configuration field. See the Added section for more info.
- `ErrReplayFailed` is removed from the public API.
- `ReplayProviderWithGC` and `Joe.ReplayGCInterval` are no more. The responsibility for garbage collection is assigned to the replay providers.

### Changed

- `Server.Logger` is now of a new type: the `Logger` interface. The dependency on x/exp/slog is removed. This opens up the possibility to adapt any existing logger to be usable with `Server`.
- The default backoff behavior has changed. The _previous_ defaults map to the new `Backoff` configuration as follows:
```go
sse.Backoff{
    InitialInterval:    5 * time.Second,  // currently 500ms
    Multiplier:         1.5,              // currently the same
    Jitter:             0.5,              // currently the same
    MaxInterval:        60 * time.Second, // currently unbounded
    MaxElapsedDuration: 15 * time.Minute, // currently unbounded
    MaxRetries:         -1,               // previously no retries by default, currently unbounded
}
```
- `Joe` now accepts new subscriptions even if replay providers panic (previously `ErrReplayFailed` would be returned).
- `Server.ServeHTTP` panics if a custom `OnSession` handler returns a `Subscription` with 0 topics

### Added

- The `Logger` interface, `LogLevel` type, and `LogLevel(Info|Warn|Error)` values.
- `Backoff` and `Client.Backoff` – the backoff strategy is now fully configurable. See the code documentation for info.
- `ValidReplayProvider.GCInterval`, to configure at which interval expired events should be cleaned up.

## [0.7.0] - 2023-11-19

This version overhauls connection retry and fixes the connection event dispatch order issue. Some internal changes to Joe were also made, which makes it faster and more resilient.

### Removed

- `ConnectionError.Temporary`
- `ConnectionError.Timeout`

### Changed

- Go's `Timeout` and `Temporary` interfaces are not used anymore – the client makes no assumptions and retries on every network or response read error. The only cases when `Connection.Connect` returns now are either when there are no more retries left (when the number is not infinite), or when the request context was cancelled.
- `*url.Error`s that occur on the HTTP request are now unwrapped and their cause is put inside a `ConnectionError`.
- `Connection.Connect` doesn't suppress any errors anymore: the request context errors are returned as is, all other errors are wrapped inside `ConnectionError`.
- On reconnection attempt, the response reset error is now wrapped inside `ConnectionError`. With this change, all errors other than the context errors are wrapped inside `ConnectionError`.
- Subscription callbacks are no longer called in individual goroutines. This caused messages to be received in an indereminate order. Make sure that your callbacks do not block for too long!

### Changed

- If a `ReplayProvider` method panics when called by `Joe`, instead of closing itself completely it just stops replaying, putting or GC-ing messages to upcoming clients. `Joe` continues to function as if no replay provider was given. A stack trace is printed to stderr when such a panic occurs.

## [0.6.0] - 2023-07-22

This version brings a number of refactors to the server-side tooling the library offers. Constructors and construction related types are removed, for ease of use and reduced API size, concerns regarding topics and expiry were separated from `Message`, logging of the `Server` is upgraded to structured logging and messages can be now published to multiple topics at once. Request upgrading has also been refactored to provide a more functional API, and the `Server` logic can now be customized without having to create a distinct handler.

### Removed

- `Message.ExpiresAt` is no more.
- `Message.Topic` is no more. See the changes to `Server`, `Provider` and `ReplayProvider` for handling topics – you can now publish a message to multiple topics at once.
- `Message.Writer` is no more. The API was redundant – one can achieve the same using `strings.Builder` and `Message.AppendData`. See the `MessageWriter` example for more.
- `NewValidReplayProvider` is no more.
- `NewFiniteReplayProvider` is no more.
- `NewJoe` is no more.
- `JoeConfig` is no more.
- `Server.Subscribe` is no more – it never made sense.
- `Server.Provider` is no more.
- `NewServer`, `ServerOption` and friends are no more.
- The `Logger` interface and the capability of the `Server` to use types that implement `Logger` as logging systems is removed.
- `SubscriptionCallback` is no more (see the change to the `Subscription` type in the "Changed" section).

### Added

- Because the `ValidReplayProvider` constructor was removed, the fields `ValidReplayProvider.{TTL,AutoIDs}` were added for configuration.
- Because the `FiniteReplayProvider` constructor was removed, the fields `FiniteReplayProvider.{Count,AutoIDs}` were added for configuration.
- Because the `Joe` constructor was removed, the fields `Joe.{ReplayProvider,ReplayGCInterval}` were added for configuration.
- Because the `Server` constructor was removed, the field `Server.Provider` was added for configuration.
- New `MessageWriter` interface; used by providers to send messages and implemented by `Session` (previously named `Request`).
- New `ResponseWriter` interface, which is a `http.ResponseWriter` augmented with a `Flush` method.
- `ValidReplayProvider` has a new field `Now` which allows providing a custom current time getter, like `time.Now`, to the provider. Enables deterministic testing of dependents on `ValidReplayProvider`.
- New `Server.OnSession` field, which enables customization of `Server`'s response and subscriptions.
- New `Server.Logger` field, which enables structured logging with logger retrieved from the request and customizable config of logged information.

### Changed

- `ReplayProvider.Put` takes a simple `*Message` and returns a `*Message`, instead of changing the `*Message` to which the `**Message` parameter points.
  It also takes a slice of topics, given that the `Message` doesn't hold the topic itself anymore. If the Message cannot be put, the method must now panic – see documentation for info.
- Because `Message.ExpiresAt` is removed, the `ValidReplayProvider` sets the expiry itself.
- `Server.Publish` now takes a list of topics.
- `Provider.Publish` now takes a non-empty slice of topics.
- `ReplayProvider.Put` now takes a non-empty slice of topics.
- `Provider.Stop` is now `Provider.Shutdown` and takes now a `context.Context` as a parameter.
- `Server.Shutdown` takes now a `context.Context` as a parameter.
- `Request` is now named `Session` and exposes the HTTP request, response writer, and the last event ID of the request.
- A new method `Flush` is added to `Session`; messages are no longer flushed by default, which allows providers, replay providers to batch send messages.
- `Upgrade` now takes an `*http.Request` as its second parameter.
- `Subscription` now has a `Client` field of type `MessageWriter` instead of a `Callback`.
- Given the `Subscription` change, `Provider.Subscribe` and `ReplayProvider.Replay` now report message sending errors.


## [0.5.2] - 2023-07-12

### Added

- The new `Message.Writer` – write to the `Message` as if it is an `io.Writer`.

### Fixed

- `Message.UnmarshalText` now strips the leading Unicode BOM, if it exists, as per the specification.
- When parsing events client-side, BOM removal was attempted on each event input. Now the BOM is correctly removed only when parsing is started.

## [0.5.1] - 2023-07-12

### Fixed

- `Message.WriteTo` now writes nothing if `Message` is empty.
- `Message.WriteTo` does not attempt to write the `retry` field if `Message.Retry` is not at least 1ms.
- `NewType` error message is updated to say "event type", not "event name".

## [0.5.0] - 2023-07-11

This version comes with a series of internal refactorings that improve code readability and performance. It also replaces usage of `[]byte` for event data with `string` – SSE is a UTF-8 encoded text-based protocol, so raw bytes never made sense. This migration improves code safety (less `unsafe` usage and less worry about ownership) and reduces the memory footprint of some objects.

Creating events on the server is also revised – fields that required getters and setters, apart from `data` and comments, are now simple public fields on the `sse.Message` struct.

Across the codebase, to refer to the value of the `event` field the name "event type" is used, which is the nomenclature used in the SSE specification.

Documentation and examples were also fixed and improved.

### Added

- New `sse.EventName` type, which holds valid values for the `event` field, together with constructors (`sse.Name` and `sse.NewName`).

### Removed

- `sse.Message`: `AppendText` was removed, as part of the migration from byte slices to strings. SSE is a UTF-8 encoded text-based protocol – raw bytes never made sense.

### Changed

- Minimum supported Go version was bumped from 1.16 to 1.19. From now on, the latest two major Go versions will be supported.
- `sse.Message`: `AppendData` takes `string`s instead of `[]byte`.
- `sse.Message`: `Comment` is now named `AppendComment`, for consistency with `AppendData`.
- `sse.Message`: The message's expiration is not reset anymore by `UnmarshalText`.
- `sse.Message`: `UnmarshalText` now unmarshals comments aswell.
- `sse.Message`: `WriteTo` (and `MarshalText` and `String` as a result) replaces all newline sequences in data with LF.
- `sse.Message`: The `Expiry` getter and `SetExpiresAt`, `SetTTL` setters are replaced by the public field `ExpiresAt`.
- `sse.Message`: Event ID getter and setter are replaced by the public `ID` field.
- `sse.Message`: Event type (previously named `Name`) getter and setter are replaced by the public `Type` field.
- `sse.Message`: The `retry` field value is now a public field on the struct. As a byproduct, `WriteTo` will now make 1 allocation when writing events with the `retry` field set. 
- `sse.NewEventID` is now `sse.NewID`, and `sse.MustEventID` is `sse.ID`.
- `sse.Event`: The `Data` field is now of type `string`, not `[]byte`.
- `sse.Event`: The `Name` field is now named `Type`.

### Fixed

- `sse.Message`: `Clone` now copies the topic of the message to the new value.
- `sse.Message`: ID fields that contain NUL characters are now ignored, as required by the spec, in `UnmarshalText`.

## [0.4.3] - 2023-07-08

### Fixed

- Messages longer than 4096 bytes are no longer being dropped ([#2], thanks [@aldld])
- Event parsing no longer panics on empty field with colon after name, see [test case](https://github.com/tmaxmax/go-sse/blob/4938f99db3bf7a8f057cb3e21ca88df57db3c0e0/internal/parser/field_parser_test.go#L37-L45) for example ([#5])

## [0.4.2] - 2021-10-17

### Added

- Get the event name of a Message

## [0.4.1] - 2021-10-15

### Added

- Set a custom logger for Server

## [0.4.0] - 2021-10-15

### Changed

- Server does not set any other headers besides `Content-Type`.
- UpgradedRequest does not return a SendError anymore when Write errors.
- Providers don't handle callback errors anymore. Callbacks return a flag that indicates whether the provider should keep calling it for new messages instead.

### Fixed

- Client's default response validator now ignores `Content-Type` parameters when checking if the response's content type is `text/event-stream`.
- Various optimizations

## [0.3.0] - 2021-09-18

### Added

- ReplayProviderWithGC interface, which must be satisfied by replay providers that must be cleaned up periodically.

### Changed

- Subscriptions now take a callback function instead of a channel.
- Server response headers are now sent on the first Send call, not when Upgrade is called.
- Providers are not required to add the default topic anymore. Callers of Subscribe should ensure at least a topic is specified.
- Providers' Subscribe method now blocks until the subscriber is removed.
- Server's Subscribe method automatically adds the default topic if no topic is specified.
- ReplayProvider does not require for GC to be implemented.
- Client connections take callback functions instead of channels as event listeners.
- Client connections' Unsubscribe methods are replaced by functions returned by their Subscribe counterparts.

### Fixed

- Fix replay providers not replaying the oldest message if the ID provided is of the one before that one.
- Fix replay providers hanging the caller's goroutine when a write error occurs using the default ServeHTTP implementation.
- Fix providers hanging when a write error occurs using the default ServeHTTP implementation.

## [0.2.0] - 2021-09-13

### Added

- Text/JSON marshalers and unmarshalers, and SQL scanners and valuers for the EventID type (previously event.ID).
- Check for http.NoBody before resetting the request body on client reconnect.

### Changed

- Package structure. The module is now refactored into a single package with an idiomatic name. This has resulted in various name changes:
  - `client.Error` - `sse.ConnectionError`
  - `event.Event` - `sse.Message` (previous `server.Message` is removed, see next change)
  - `event.ID` - `sse.EventID`
  - `event.NewID` - `sse.NewEventID`
  - `event.MustID` - `sse.MustEventID`
  - `server.Connection` - `sse.UpgradedRequest`
  - `server.NewConnection` - `sse.Upgrade`
  - `server.ErrUnsupported` - `sse.ErrUpgradeUnsupported`
  - `server.New` - `sse.NewServer`.
- `event.Event` is merged with `server.Message`, becoming `sse.Message`. This affects the `sse.Server.Publish` function, which doesn't take a `topic` parameter anymore.
- The server's constructor doesn't take an `Provider` as a parameter. It instead takes multiple optional `ServerOptions`. The `WithProvider` option is now used to pass custom providers to the server.
- The `ReplayProvider` interface's `Put` method now takes a `**Message` instead of a `*Message`. This change also affects the replay providers in this package: `ValidReplayProvider` and `FiniteReplayProvider`.
- The `Provider` interface's `Publish` method now takes a `*Message` instead of a `Message`. This change also affects `Joe`, the provider in this package.
- The `UpgradedRequest`'s `Send` now method takes a `*Message` as parameter.
