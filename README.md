## Installation and usage

Install the package using `go get`:

```sh
go get -u github.com/tmaxmax/go-sse
```

It is strongly recommended to use tagged versions of `go-sse` in your projects. The `master` branch has tested but unreleased and maybe undocumented changes, which may break backwards compatibility - use with caution.

The library provides both server-side and client-side implementations of the protocol. The implementations are completely decoupled and unopinionated: you can connect to a server created using `go-sse` from the browser and you can connect to any server that emits events using the client!

If you are not familiar with the protocol or not sure how it works, read [MDN's guide for using server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events). [The spec](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html) is also useful read!

`go-sse` promises to support the [Go versions supported by the Go team](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#policy) – that is, the 2 most recent major releases.

## Cut to the chase – how do I read my LLM's response?

If you're here just to read ChatGPT's, Claude's or whichever LLM's response stream, you're in the right place! Let's take a look at [`sse.Read`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/tmaxmax/go-sse#Read): you just make your HTTP request the same way you'd do for any other API and call it on the request body. Here's some code:

```go
req, _ := http.NewRequestWithContext(ctx, http.MethodPost, "https://api.yourllm.com/v1/chat/completions", payload)
req.Header.Set("Content-Type", "application/json")
req.Header.Set("Authorization", "Bearer "+yourKey)

res, err := http.DefaultClient.Do(req)
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
defer res.Body.Close() // don't forget!!

for ev, err := range sse.Read(res.Body, nil) {
    if err != nil {
        // handle read error
        break // can end the loop as Read stops on first error anyway
    }
    // Do something with the events, parse the JSON or whatever.
}
```

See the [LLM example](cmd/llm/main.go) for a fully working Go program.

Go 1.23 iterators (officially ["range-over-func"](https://go.dev/blog/range-functions)) are used for this feature. If you are still on Go 1.22 use the `GOEXPERIMENT=rangefunc` environment variable (e.g. `GOEXPERIMENT=rangefunc go run main.go`) or use the iterator without the syntactic sugar:
```go
events(func(ev Event) bool {
    // do something with event
    return true // or false to stop iteration
})
```

`sse.Read` is also useful if you're implementing an LLM SDK: call it in your code and spare yourself time and maintenance burden by not reimplementing event stream parsing.

## Implementing a server

### Providers and why they are vital

First, a server instance has to be created:

```go
import "github.com/tmaxmax/go-sse"

s := &sse.Server{} // zero value ready to use!
```

The `sse.Server` type also implements the `http.Handler` interface, but a server is framework-agnostic: See the [`ServeHTTP` implementation](https://github.com/tmaxmax/go-sse/blob/master/server/server.go#L156) to learn how to implement your own custom logic. It also has some additional configuration options:

```go
s := &sse.Server{
    Provider: /* what goes here? find out next! */,
    OnSession: /* see Go docs for this one */,
    Logger: /* see Go docs for this one, too */,
}
```

What is this "provider"? A provider is an implementation of the publish-subscribe messaging system:

```go
type Provider interface {
    // Publish a message to all subscribers of the given topics.
    Publish(msg *Message, topics []string) error
    // Add a new subscriber that is unsubscribed when the context is done.
    Subscribe(ctx context.Context, sub Subscription) error
    // Cleanup all resources and stop publishing messages or accepting subscriptions.
    Shutdown(ctx context.Context) error
}
```

The provider is what dispatches events to clients. When you publish a message (an event), the provider distributes it to all connections (subscribers). It is the central piece of the server: it determines the maximum number of clients your server can handle, the latency between broadcasting events and receiving them client-side and the maximum message throughput supported by your server. As different use cases have different needs, `go-sse` allows to plug in your own system. Some examples of such external systems are:

- [RabbitMQ streams](https://blog.rabbitmq.com/posts/2021/07/rabbitmq-streams-overview/)
- [Redis pub-sub](https://redis.io/topics/pubsub)
- [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/)
- Your own! For example, you can mock providers in testing.

If an external system is required, an adapter that satisfies the `Provider` interface must be created so it can then be used with `go-sse`. To implement such an adapter, read [the Provider documentation][2] for implementation requirements! And maybe share them with others: `go-sse` is built with reusability in mind!

But in most cases the power and scalability that these external systems bring is not necessary, so `go-sse` comes with a default provider builtin. Read further!

### Meet Joe, the default provider

The server still works by default, without a provider. `go-sse` brings you Joe: the trusty, pure Go pub-sub implementation, who handles all your events by default! Befriend Joe as following:

```go
import "github.com/tmaxmax/go-sse"

joe := &sse.Joe{} // the zero value is ready to use!
```

and he'll dispatch events all day! By default, he has no memory of what events he has received, but you can help him remember and replay older messages to new clients using a `Replayer`:

```go
type Replayer interface {
    // Put a new event in the provider's buffer.
    // If the provider automatically adds IDs as well,
    // the returned message will also have the ID set,
    // otherwise the input value is returned.
    Put(msg *Message, topics []string) (*Message, error)
    // Replay valid events to a subscriber.
    Replay(sub Subscription) error
}
```

`go-sse` provides two replayers by default, which both hold the events in-memory: the `ValidReplayer` and `FiniteReplayer`. The first replays events that are valid, not expired, the second replays a finite number of the most recent events. For example:

```go
// Let's have events expire after 5 minutes. For this example we don't enable automatic ID generation.
r, err := sse.NewValidReplayer(time.Minute * 5, false)
if err != nil {
    // TTL was 0 or negative.
    // Useful to have this error if the value comes from a config which happens to be faulty.
}

joe = &sse.Joe{Replayer: r}
```

will tell Joe to replay all valid events! Replayers can do so much more (for example, add IDs to events automatically): read the [docs][3] on how to use the existing ones and how to implement yours.

You can also implement your own replayers: maybe you need persistent storage for your events? Or event validity is determined based on other criteria than expiry time? And if you think your replayer may be useful to others, you are encouraged to share it!

`go-sse` created the `Replayer` interface mainly for `Joe`, but it encourages you to integrate it with your own `Provider` implementations, where suitable.

### Publish your first event

To publish events from the server, we use the `sse.Message` struct:

```go
import "github.com/tmaxmax/go-sse"

m := &sse.Message{}
m.AppendData("Hello world!", "Nice\nto see you.")
```

Now let's send it to our clients:

```go
var s *sse.Server

s.Publish(m)
```

This is how clients will receive our event:

```txt
data: Hello world!
data: Nice
data: to see you.
```

You can also see that `go-sse` takes care of splitting input by lines into new fields, as required by the specification.

Keep in mind that replayers, such as the `ValidReplayer` used above, will give an error for and won't replay the events without an ID (unless, of course, they give the IDs themselves). To have our event expire, as configured, we must set an ID for the event:

```go
m.ID = sse.ID("unique")
```

This is how the event will look:

```txt
id: unique
data: Hello world!
data: Nice
data: to see you.
```

Now that it has an ID, the event will be considered expired 5 minutes after it's been published – it won't be replayed to clients after it expires!

`sse.ID` is a function that returns an `EventID` – a special type that denotes an event's ID. An ID must not have newlines, so we must use special functions which validate the value beforehand. The `ID` constructor function we've used above panics (it is useful when creating IDs from static strings), but there's also `NewID`, which returns an error indicating whether the value was successfully converted to an ID or not:

```go
id, err := sse.NewID("invalid\nID")
```

Here, `err` will be non-nil and `id` will be an unset value: no `id` field will be sent to clients if you set an event's ID using that value!

Setting the event's type (the `event` field) is equally easy:

```go
m.Type = sse.Type("The event's name")
```

Like IDs, types cannot have newlines. You are provided with constructors that follow the same convention: `Type` panics, `NewType` returns an error. Read the [docs][4] to find out more about messages and how to use them!

### The server-side "Hello world"

Now, let's put everything that we've learned together! We'll create a server that sends a "Hello world!" message every second to all its clients, with Joe's help:

```go
package main

import (
    "log"
    "net/http"
    "time"

    "github.com/tmaxmax/go-sse"
)

func main() {
    s := &sse.Server{}

    go func() {
        m := &sse.Message{}
        m.AppendData("Hello world")

        for range time.Tick(time.Second) {
            _ = s.Publish(m)
        }
    }()

    if err := http.ListenAndServe(":8000", s); err != nil {
        log.Fatalln(err)
    }
}
```

Joe is our default provider here, as no provider is given to the server constructor. The server is already an `http.Handler` so we can use it directly with `http.ListenAndServe`.

[Also see a more complex example!](cmd/complex/main.go)

This is by far a complete presentation, make sure to read the docs in order to use `go-sse` to its full potential!

## Using the client

### Creating a client

We will use the `sse.Client` type for connecting to event streams:

```go
type Client struct {
    HTTPClient              *http.Client
    OnRetry                 backoff.Notify
    ResponseValidator       ResponseValidator
    MaxRetries              int
    DefaultReconnectionTime time.Duration
}
```

As you can see, it uses a `net/http` client. It also uses the [cenkalti/backoff][1] library for implementing auto-reconnect when a connection to a server is lost. Read the [client docs][5] and the Backoff library's docs to find out how to configure the client. We'll use the default client the package provides for further examples.

### Initiating a connection

We must first create an `http.Request` - yup, a fully customizable request:

```go
req, err := http.NewRequestWithContext(ctx, http.MethodGet, "host", http.NoBody)
```

Any kind of request is valid as long as your server handler supports it: you can do a GET, a POST, send a body; do whatever! The context is used as always for cancellation - to stop receiving events you will have to cancel the context.
Let's initiate a connection with this request:

```go
import "github.com/tmaxmax/go-sse"

conn := sse.DefaultClient.NewConnection(req)
// you can also do sse.NewConnection(req)
// it is an utility function that calls the
// NewConnection method on the default client
```

### Subscribing to events

Great! Let's imagine the event stream looks as following:

```txt
data: some unnamed event

event: I have a name
data: some data

event: Another name
data: some data
```

To receive the unnamed events, we subscribe to them as following:

```go
unsubscribe := conn.SubscribeMessages(func (event sse.Event) {
    // do something with the event
})
```

To receive the events named "I have a name":

```go
unsubscribe := conn.SubscribeEvent("I have a name", func (event sse.Event) {
    // do something with the event
})
```

If you want to subscribe to all events, regardless of their name:

```go
unsubscribe := conn.SubscribeToAll(func (event sse.Event) {
    // do something with the event
})
```

All `Subscribe` methods return a function that when called tells the connection to stop calling the corresponding callback.

In order to work with events, the `sse.Event` type has some fields and methods exposed:

```go
type Event struct {
    LastEventID string
    Name        string
    Data        string
}
```

Pretty self-explanatory, but make sure to read the [docs][6]!

Now, with this knowledge, let's subscribe to all unnamed events and, when the connection is established, print their data:

```go
unsubscribe := conn.SubscribeMessages(func(event sse.Event) {
    fmt.Printf("Received an unnamed event: %s\n", event.Data)
})
```

### Establishing the connection

Great, we are subscribed now! Let's start receiving events:

```go
err := conn.Connect()
```

By calling `Connect`, the request created above will be sent to the server, and if successful, the subscribed callbacks will be called when new events are received. `Connect` returns only after all callbacks have finished executing.
To stop calling a certain callback, call the unsubscribe function returned when subscribing. You can also subscribe new callbacks after calling Connect from a different goroutine.
When using a `context.Context` to stop the connection, the error returned will be the context error – be it `context.Canceled`, `context.DeadlineExceeded` or a custom cause (when using `context.WithCancelCause`). In other words, a successfully closed `Connection` will always return an error – if the context error is not relevant, you can ignore it. For example:

```go
if err := conn.Connect(); !errors.Is(err, context.Canceled) {
    // handle error
}
```

A context created with `context.WithCancel`, or one with `context.WithCancelCause` and cancelled with the error `context.Canceled` is assumed above.

There may be situations where the connection does not have to live for indeterminately long – for example when using the OpenAI API. In those situations, configure the client to not retry the connection and ignore `io.EOF` on return:

```go
client := sse.Client{
    Backoff: sse.Backoff{
        MaxRetries: -1,
    },
    // other settings...
}

req, _ := http.NewRequest(http.MethodPost, "https://api.openai.com/...", body)
conn := client.NewConnection(req)

conn.SubscribeMessages(/* callback */)

if err := conn.Connect(); !errors.Is(err, io.EOF) {
    // handle error
}
```

### Connection lost?

Either way, after receiving so many events, something went wrong and the server is temporarily down. Oh no! As a last hope, it has sent us the following event:

```text
retry: 60000
: that's a minute in milliseconds and this
: is a comment which is ignored by the client
```

Not a sweat, though! The connection will automatically be reattempted after a minute, when we'll hope the server's back up again. Canceling the request's context will cancel any reconnection attempt, too.

If the server doesn't set a retry time, the client's `DefaultReconnectionTime` is used.

### The "Hello world" server's client

Let's use what we know to create a client for the previous server example:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
    "os"

    "github.com/tmaxmax/go-sse"
)

func main() {
    r, _ := http.NewRequest(http.MethodGet, "http://localhost:8000", nil)
    conn := sse.NewConnection(r)

    conn.SubscribeMessages(func(ev sse.Event) {
        fmt.Printf("%s\n\n", ev.Data)
    })

    if err := conn.Connect(); err != nil {
        fmt.Fprintln(os.Stderr, err)
    }
}
```

Yup, this is it! We are using the default client to receive all the unnamed events from the server. The output will look like this, when both programs are run in parallel:

```txt
Hello world!

Hello world!

Hello world!

Hello world!

...
```
