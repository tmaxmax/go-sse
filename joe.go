// A Replayer is a type that can replay older published events to new subscribers.
// Replayers use event IDs, the topics the events were published and optionally
// any other criteria to determine which are valid for replay.
//
// While replayers can require events to have IDs beforehand, they can also set the IDs themselves,
// automatically - it's up to the implementation. Replayers should not overwrite or remove any existing
// IDs and return an error instead.
//
// Replayers are not required to be thread-safe - server providers are required to ensure only
// one operation is executed on the replayer at any given time. Server providers may not execute
// replay operation concurrently with other operations, so make sure any action on the replayer
// blocks for as little as possible. If a replayer is thread-safe, some operations may be
// run in a separate goroutine - see the interface's method documentation.
//
// Executing actions that require waiting for a long time on I/O, such as HTTP requests or database
// calls must be handled with great care, so the server provider is not blocked. Reducing them to
// the minimum by using techniques such as caching or by executing them in separate goroutines is
// recommended, as long as the implementation fulfills the requirements.
//
// If not specified otherwise, the errors returned are implementation-specific.
type Replayer interface {
	// Put adds a new event to the replay buffer. The Message that is returned may not have the
	// same address, if the replayer automatically sets IDs.
	//
	// Put errors if the message couldn't be queued – if no topics are provided,
	// a message without an ID is put into a Replayer which does not
	// automatically set IDs, or a message with an ID is put into a Replayer which
	// does automatically set IDs. An error should be returned for other failures
	// related to the given message. When no topics are provided, ErrNoTopic should be
	// returned.
	//
	// The Put operation may be executed by the replayer in another goroutine only if
	// it can ensure that any Replay operation called after the Put goroutine is started
	// can replay the new received message. This also requires the replayer implementation
	// to be thread-safe.
	//
	// Replayers are not required to guarantee that immediately after Put returns
	// the new messages can be replayed. If an error occurs internally when putting the new message
	// and retrying the operation would block for too long, it can be aborted.
	//
	// To indicate a complete replayer failure (i.e. the replayer won't work after this point)
	// a panic should be used instead of an error.

	// Replay sends to a new subscriber all the valid events received by the replayer
	// since the event with the listener's ID. If the ID the listener provides
	// is invalid, the provider should not replay any events.
	//
	// Replay calls must return only after replaying is done.
	// Implementations should not keep references to the subscription client
	// after Replay returns.
	//
	// If an error is returned, then at least some messages weren't successfully replayed.
	// The error is nil if there were no messages to replay for the particular subscription
	// or if all messages were replayed successfully.
	//
	// If any messages are replayed, Client.Flush must be called by implementations.
